**License**: GPLv3

##Description
winewrap is a fork of sjurajpuchky's wrappit4wine.  
It consists of two scripts, winewrap-dll and winewrap-so. These scripts generate files useful when creating wine wrappers for native libraries. winewrap-dll generates files using a windows dynamic link library, and winewrap-so generates files using a native library.

You can run the scripts with "--help" or see the man pages for usage information.
